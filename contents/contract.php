			<h2>Course Contract</h2>
			
			<p>
				I, <a href="introduction.php">Aimy Kohli</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, WEB250,<br>
				Database Driven Websites class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not<br>
				put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,<br>
				failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
			</p>
			
			<p>
