				  <li>Personal background: I was born and raised mostly in Charlotte, North Carolina. </li>
				  <li>Academic background: I am a CCP student. I plan to graduate from high school and also hope<br>
				  to earn my Associates in Software Development degree by this May.</li>

				  also spend time coding in Java. </li>
				  <li>Primary Computer Platform: I mostly use a Dell laptop with a Windows 10 system. </li>
				  <li>Courses I'm Taking & Why:

				  <li>Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I really love animals so I have had a variety of pets.
				  One boring summer, my brother and I made an incubator at home and bought eggs from a farm. They
				  actually hatched but for about a month we had 11 chickens running around the house. At the time I
				  had 2 other pet birds who werenâ€™t happy with the chickens running off with their food.
				  My mom made me give them away. :)</li>
				  <li>I'd also like to share: I enjoy reading books, listening to music (especially Kpop), and watching anime and dramas.</li>
