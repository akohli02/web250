		<h2>Course Contract</h2>
		
		<p>
			I, <a href="https://akohli02.github.io/web250/introduction.html">Aimy Kohli,</a> agree to abide by the terms of the course contract in my Spring 2022, WEB250,<br>
			Database Driven Websites class with my instructor, Professor D.I. von Briesen.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online tools will be available to the world, and will not<br>
			put information there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep private.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			I also understand that it is my work that counts for attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such,<br>
			failure to turn in assignments may show as absences.
		</p>
