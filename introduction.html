		 <ul>
			  <li>Personal background: I was born and raised mostly in Charlotte, North Carolina. </li>
			  <li>Academic background: I am a CCP student. I plan to graduate from high school and also hope<br>
			  to earn my Associates in Software Development degree by this May.</li>
			  <li>Background in this subject: I have always been interested in computers. I have made a few decent websites<br>
			  also spend time coding in Java. </li>
			  <li>Primary Computer Platform: I mostly use a Dell laptop with a Windows 10 system. </li>
			  <li>Courses I'm Taking & Why:
			  <ul>
					<li>CSC249-N801 - Data Structures and Algorithms - This course is required for my degree.</li>
					<li>CSC284-N801 - Emerging Comp Prog Tech - This course is required for my degree.</li>

			  <li> Funny/Interesting item about yourself: I really love animals so I have had a variety of pets.<br>
			  One boring summer, my brother and I made an incubator at home and bought eggs from a farm. They<br>
			  actually hatched but for about a month we had 11 chickens running around the house. At the time I<br>
			  had 2 other pet birds who werenâ€™t happy with the chickens running off with their food.<br>
			  My mom made me give them away. :)</li>
		      <li>I'd also like to share: I enjoy reading books, listening to music (especially Kpop), and watching anime and dramas.</li>
